# PowerBI Project

In this project, I will be working in PowerBI to build various business insights for an imaginary company called Atliq Hardware.

gdb041.sql and gdb056.sql are large dataset and stored in Microsoft SQL Server Query File. They are provided by Codebasics, an online programming learning platform. 'https://codebasics.io/'.

This project consists of several parts:

1. Import dataset gdb041 and gdb056 into MySQL Database and connect MySQL Database to PowerBI. 

2. Transform Data using Power Query Editor. (Creating a 'Date' table and merge tables.)

3. Data Modeling: Connect Dimensions with tables.

4. Build different Measures using DAX.

5. Design Effective Dashboards.

The visualization dashboards are presented in 'Power BI Project.pdf'. Please download 'Power BI Project.pbix' for further reference.
